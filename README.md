# Implement a real-time Stock trading engine for matching Stock Buys with Stock Sells.
#1. Write an ‘addOrder’ function that will have the following parameters:
#      ‘Order Type’ (Buy or Sell), ‘Ticker Symbol’, ‘Quantity’, ‘Price’
#      Support 1,024 tickers (stocks) being traded.
#      Write a wrapper to have this ‘addOrder’ function randomly execute with different parameter values to simulate active stock transactions.
#
#2. Write a ‘matchOrder’ function, that will match Buy & Sell orders with the following criteria:
#      Buy price for a particular ticker is greater than or equal to lowest Sell price available then.
#      Write your code to handle race conditions when multiple threads modify the Stock order book, as run in real-life, by multiple stockbrokers. Also, use lock-free data structures.
#      Do not use any dictionaries, maps or equivalent data structures. Essentially there should be no ‘import’-s nor ‘include’-s nor similar construct relevant to the programming language you are #      using that provides you dictionary, map or equivalent data structure capability. In essence, you are writing the entire code. Standard language-specific non data structure related items are  #      ok, but try to avoid as best as you can.
#      Write your ‘matchOrder’ function with a time-complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of orders in the Stock order book.
